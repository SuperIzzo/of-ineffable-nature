## Note

spookymanor.p8 is the main source file! The others were for testing features or working on the same bits at the same time.

If you wish to see source, please go back a few versions to see uncompressed and commented code. We had to compress this as much as possible to be able to export it from PICO-8! We had maxed out the entire space we had.
